== Deploy on iOS device (with a development certificate)

Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49268086/sending-my-flutter-app-to-my-real-iphone-instead-of-the-simulator[SO answer].

Note the phone must be connected to the computer via the USB cable.

1. Open the default Xcode workspace in your project by running `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in a
   terminal window from your Flutter project directory.

2. In Xcode, select the _Runner_ project in the left navigation panel.

3. In the _Runner_ target settings page, make sure your _Development Team_ is
   selected under _General_ > _Signing_ > _Team_.
   When you select a team, Xcode creates and downloads a Development Certificate, registers your device
   with your account, and creates and downloads a provisioning profile.

You should do step 1-3 only once, from now on, your Mac got certificates and provision profiles, you can
run "flutter devices" to see registered device.


Also review the XCode project settings (https://flutter.io/docs/deployment/ios#review-xcode-project-settings)

- XCode `Bundle identifier` changed to `com.github.bric3.app1`
- Set `Automatically manage signing` to `true`
- Set your team
- `Deployment target` set to `8.0` (minimum supported versions)

Eventually it may be needed to run the app from XCode.
